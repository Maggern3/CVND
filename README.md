# CVND
My implementations of the projects in Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree.
For the first project the goal is to create a convolutional neural network to recognize facial keypoints trained on the YouTube faces dataset.
The second project's goal is to generate descriptive and accurate captions for images using a combination of CNN's and RNN's.
The final project is an implementation of SLAM(simultaneous localization and mapping) a tehnique used in robotics and autonomous systems.
